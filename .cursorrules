When implementing new features or making changes:
1. Follow the established code patterns and naming conventions
2. Use the project's architecture (Server/Client component split, lib/ layer for business logic)
3. Match the existing styling patterns (dark theme, Tailwind conventions)
4. Write tests following the testing conventions
5. Avoid the anti-patterns listed in the "Don't Do" section

When receiving instructions that define new standards, design patterns, or architectural decisions, propose updates to AGENTS.md to document them for future sessions.
